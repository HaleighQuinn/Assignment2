## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Reading and Filtering the Data: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

years <- 2017:2020
quarters <- 1:4
types <- c("Electric", "Gas")
months <- 1:42
pge_elec_gas <- NULL

for (quarter in quarters){
  for (year in years){
    for (type in types){
       if ((quarter %in% 3:4) & (year %in% 2020)){
        next 
       }
      
      filename <- 
        paste0(
          "PGE_",
          year, 
          "_Q", 
          quarter,
          "_",
          type,
          "UsageByZip.csv"
        )
     
      print(filename)
      
      
      temp <- read_csv(filename)
      
      if(type %in% "Gas"){
        print(temp)
        temp <- temp %>% 
          mutate(TOTALKBTU = 100 * TOTALTHM) %>% 
          select(-TOTALTHM, -AVERAGETHM)
      } else {
        temp <- temp %>% 
        mutate(TOTALKBTU = 3.412 * TOTALKWH) %>% 
          select(-TOTALKWH, -AVERAGEKWH)
      }
      
      pge_elec_gas <- rbind(pge_elec_gas, temp)

    }
